                        <p class="fs-4 px-3">    Costi Survival world 1 was the first mainline world in the series. It had many buildings and government ideas that persisted to its successors. The world was created in Minecraft Pocket Edition by Costi and had an "Old" world type, which meant very limited space was available. Some very notable landmarks in this world were the twin towers, vector's lair, the lab, nether reactor area, and advanced irrigation system. <br />    The twin towers were a set of two fairly large stone-brick buildings that were both owned by Costi. These toweres had many bridges between them and connected to the advanced irrigation network to have waterfalls on some of the stories. Vector's lair was originally the world's first cave house. Built into a mountain, all players used it for shelter against nocternal enemies. Later on, everyone moved away to create their own houses. Near the end of the world's lifespan, Costi renovated the interior with white and orange wool and quartz stairs to give a 'modern' appearance. The lab was an underground facility located near the community mines and quarry. It featured a floor that was made of glass to show water and lava flowing underneath from the irrigation system. Finally, the irrigation system was a network of aquaducts all flowing from a single waterfall. This was necessary because at the time, there were no buckets implemented into the game. The water flowed from the waterfall to the community farm, twin towers, and the underground lab.</p>
