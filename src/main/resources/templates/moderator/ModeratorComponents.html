        Costi Online is now able to serve <strong>dynamic content</strong>. This allows me to add, remove, or change the content hosted on this site in the home, projects, media, wiki, newsroom, Minecraft, tree, about, and other pages. Although this change may seem mundane, it unlocks powerful tools such as referencing newsroom or wiki posts. I can also create seasonal or event based content on demand. Stay tuned for more changes!

                        I am Costi, often pronounced as "Coasty." Currently, I am a dedicated student at San Jose State University, diligently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with an anticipated graduation in the spring of 2024. My passion for exploring cutting-edge technological advancements has been a constant since I was eight years old.
                        <br />
                        Beyond my academic pursuits, I allocate my free time purposefully. I am enthusiastic about socializing with friends, engaging in coding projects, creating videos, and indulging in video games. Professionally, I have garnered over three years of invaluable experience, currently serving as a cybersecurity intern for the City of San Jose.

            <p class="fs-4">
                In May 2022, I embarked on the development journey of Costi Online, a personal project conceived with the primary goal of showcasing my Minecraft worlds. Beyond this, it also served as a platform to rigorously test and hone my skills in various domains, including front-end and back-end development, hosting infrastructure, and user experience (UX) design.
                <br />
                <br />
                Originally conceived as a companion website for my self-hosted Minecraft server, Costi Online has undergone a remarkable evolution, expanding its scope to encompass a wider array of topics and functionalities.
                <br />
                <br />
                The genesis of this personal website was not without precedent. Prior attempts at crafting my own digital presence had been made during my coding journey, but none had reached a state of full development or readiness for deployment. It took approximately a month of dedicated effort to bring forth the inaugural publicly released version of Costi Online, which was initially focused exclusively on the Minecraft server.
                <br />
                <br />
                Since then, the website has seen a continuous influx of features and improvements, with some changes being more substantial than others. Notably, the transition from an H2 database to MySQL marked a pivotal point in its development, enhancing its data handling capabilities. Additionally, the incorporation of an API has empowered the website with greater interactivity and flexibility. Furthermore, the entire platform now runs seamlessly on a self-hosted Linux machine, underscoring my commitment to managing every aspect of its infrastructure.
                <br />
                <br />
                Costi Online draws inspiration not only from my prior work but also from various personal websites I've encountered over time. It stands as a testament to my dedication to ongoing self-improvement and my passion for presenting my technical skills and projects to the digital world.

    <h2 class="pb-2 border-bottom">About Costi Survival World X</h2>
    <p class="fs-4">The Costi Survival World X is the latest collaborative survival world server. This world is a successor to CSW9, which was my second attempt at a Java-based server. We have since switched to Minecraft Bedrock edition for CSWX. This world started in mid to late 2022 and has been used in large waves by its user base. The world contains an in-game government system that is currently very libertarian. There is currently a single city in the world: Constantinople (a tradition started in CSW5) that contains a large number of districts, including the liberal district, Jeremy Biome district, and luxury district. The world currently has approximately 5 regularly playing members, with others that log on more occasionally. Although this world now the longest running Costi Survival World, the amount of hours spent in game is still less than CSW5.</p>

                    <p class="fs-4">The current version of the CSWX government grants federal powers to Costi. There is only one city so far in the world, Constantinople, in which people can live in.</p>
                    <h4 class="fw-bold">Federal Government</h4>
                    <p class="fs-4">The federal government will only consist of the world president, Costi. Like previous worlds, this position is not up for election. The federal government's powers includes but is not limited to: banning laws from passing, stopping or creating construction, zoning, and citizenship granting. Historically, this position did not interfere much with local government.</p>
                    <h4 class="fw-bold">Local Government</h4>
                    <p class="fs-4">The local government consists of a mayoral position. Mayors are elected every 6 months and have unlimited terms. Mayors are not able to manage more than 1 city at a time. Mayors can make meant changes to their cities including: creating/ removing public buildings, creating railways, making ordinances, and even changing the economic system of their cities. They are unable to take away or interfere with purchased property unless there is a special exception from the federal government. If you want to be a mayor, it is highly recommended that you have a lot of materials, as unless you create a tax system, all projects will be funded by you!</p>

                        <p class="fs-4">Costi Survival world 1 was the first mainline world in the series. It had many buildings and government ideas that persisted to its successors. The world was created in Minecraft Pocket Edition by Costi and had an "Old" world type, which meant very limited space was available. Some very notable landmarks in this world were the twin towers, vector's lair, the lab, nether reactor area, and advanced irrigation system.</p>
                        <p class="fs-4">The twin towers were a set of two fairly large stone-brick buildings that were both owned by Costi. These towers had many bridges between them and connected to the advanced irrigation network to have waterfalls on some of the stories. Vector's lair was originally the world's first cave house. Built into a mountain, all players used it for shelter against nocturnal enemies. Later on, everyone moved away to create their own houses. Near the end of the world's lifespan, Costi renovated the interior with white and orange wool and quartz stairs to give a 'modern' appearance. The lab was an underground facility located near the community mines and quarry. It featured a floor that was made of glass to show water and lava flowing underneath from the irrigation system. Finally, the irrigation system was a network of aqueducts all flowing from a single waterfall. This was necessary because at the time, there were no buckets implemented into the game. The water flowed from the waterfall to the community farm, twin towers, and the underground lab.</p>
                        <p class="fs-4">This world lasted quite a long time. Being active for approximately 20 weeks, it is currently the second longest Costi survival world. There were many ideas from this world that was passed along to the next worlds. For example, the first versions of Costi building architecture was invented in this world. Buildings with this architecture are mostly built from stone bricks and glass.</p>

It was hosted on Costi's Xbox 360 system which used Minecraft Xbox 360 Edition (obviously). This brought on many new features, dimensions, and blocks to the world. Costi, Alex, Georges, and Marc all lived in a swamp biome house surrounded by tamed dogs. There is not much information known about this world, as it was not as influential as the others.</p>

                            <p class="fs-4">Costi Survival world 3 started as a private world for Alex that he created for himself
                                unbeknownst to anyone else taking interest. Alex was wandering and fell into a ravine. He didn‚Äôt know how to get out because he had no wood or tools on him, so he set up base in the ravine. He then started to explore the rest of the world and set up outposts in certain places, like the desert and the plains. Shortly after, Costi wanted to play, and he ended up buying the plains outpost for some dirt and seeds. He would cultivate the land to become a large farm plain and then build more buildings on it. Amal and Christina also joined in building their own homes there as well. The desert outpost became Egypt and Costi‚Äôs domain became Constantinople. Constantinople had a large wheat field and a city hall built into a mountain nearby that was never finished or used. Alex still decided to mostly move into the town and set up a store that sold food. Besides that, the town was very small and had little to see or offer.
                                <br />Later in the life of the World, Alex started to have tension with the rest of the group and declared a nation out of all parts of the world but a small part in the very center of the world that was Constantinople. After some arguments about borders, Alex and Costi agreed on having a sizable circular-ish shaped border of Constantinople that contained only one biome and no open waters. Alex took the entire rest of the world, calling it and its main town Alexandria. He started building near the old ravine a very large and elevated house and a walk-up spiral tower that went almost to the world height limit. In contention, Costi built a large tower that contained a restaurant at the very top to the world limit. The world died when there was a failed attempt to mod the WII U that ended up bricking the system.</p>

                        <p class="fs-4">Costi Survival World 4 was a short-lived minecraft world that was created on Costi's second Wii U. Originally created by Alex, Costi and Georges decided to begin playing on the world. Everyone lived in a 3-story wooden tower. Alex had the first floor, Costi had the second floor, and Georges had...a hallway in Costi's floor. The third floor had a conference table. Next to the tower, there was a sizeable animal and agricultural farm with almost every animal at the time. In front of the building, there was a large desert with a neighboring villager village. One interesting fact about this world is Costi and Alex by chance discovered skeleton horses in the surrounding woods. There was also a fishing outpost on a neighboring island Alex liked to call "Dolphin Island," due to its resemblance to Dolphin Island in Blooper Beach for Mario Party 9.</p>
                        <p class="fs-4">Costi wanted to develop a modern city in the distance and was in the process of collecting resources to construct the first buildings, when the world became inactive. While it is unknown why the world ended, it may have been due to the fascination with the Minecraft online mini games and the included voice chat.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold">Costi Survival World 5 (2017)</h3>
                        <p class="fs-4">Survival World 5 was the longest by far. It started out very humbly in 2017 with a 4-story wooden tower that everyone was forced to live in. Moving out was strictly prohibited. With limited technology, players managed to get a farm with livestock on the upper levels of the structure. At one point, Costi decided that they were rich enough to start expanding outwards into what would eventually become Constantinople. </p>
                        <h4 class="fw-bold">Government Structure</h4>
                        <p class="fs-4">Constantinople was the first city in history to have a formal democratic republic governmental structure. There were two levels of government: the federal government and city government. The federal government was only managed by Costi which granted the power to deny buildings and structures. There were 3 cities, each with their own mayor. Mayors had the power to change anything they wanted about their cities, their potential power only stopped at sizing property. Mayors were elected every 3 months </p>
                        <h4 class="fw-bold">The City of Constantinople</h4>
                        <p class="fs-4">Constantinople's permanent mayor, Costi, implemented many restrictions including: all citizens must have property in the city, every residence needs to have a mailbox and a clear display of their color of wool (uniquely assigned to every citizen), as well as a sign with their name. Costi also introduced "builder permits", which restricted building projects to selected people and only for approved projects. At this time, Costi architecture remained the same as world 3. All buildings were made out of stone bricks primarily, with large glass windows and a lava column on each corner of every floor for lighting. </p>
                        <p class="fs-4">Despite the numerous restrictions the city flourished and lasted incredibly long. Everyone moved out of the tower into their own homes pretty quickly and people were content enough with their homes to not move. Notable buildings included: LLAMA, a costco like structure that used to have a llama shop that closed down and then was taken over by Alex‚Äôs goods monopoly; City hall, which had over 15 stories with an office for everyone who has ever played on the world, a city council room, and a minecart elevator. It was built over what used to be the small residential tower; A farm tower with floors sold to people for their agricultural value; a pool; two watchtowers; a decorative lava fountain; an emerald bank + vault; central recycling system; pier; event center; Massive Aquarium; and industrial smelter, among many more</p>
                        <p class="fs-4">Overtime, the addition of new cities (will be discussed soon) meant that Costi had to compete with desert and beach towns. He ended up making 5 districts that massively expanded the area of the city.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p class="fs-4">Urban District: The starting area that eventually became the metropolis</p></li>
                            <li><p class="fs-4">Agricultural district: Publicly accessible farm area featuring a large glass barn and sizeable field</p></li>
                            <li><p class="fs-4">Underwater district: a series of glass hemisphere homes submerged underwater and connected to a central hub</p></li>
                            <li><p class="fs-4">Modern House district: featuring modern-style homes</p></li>
                            <li><p class="fs-4">Libertarian district: A unique part of Constantinople where citizens buy plots of land where they can build whatever they wanted</p></li>
                            <li><p class="fs-4">Villager district: a small area that contained a synthetic villager village, used for trading</p></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="fs-4">Later in the lifespan of the server, residents in the urban district of Constantinople asked for their buildings to be updated to have a more modern look and feel. Costi's response to this was creating an entirely new architectural style and applying it to all public and private buildings. This new stlye featured white concrete and jungle wood planks as a replacement to stone bricks. It also got rid of the lava columns and replaced it with glowstone or glowstone lamps.</p>
                        <p class="fs-4">Additionally, Constantinople featured an underground subway hub that could transport you to any relevant destination in the world including other districts, cities, and even the end portal (which had a ride time of about 5 minutes one way). The central hub used redstone to allow citizens to choose their destination with a click of a button and was developed by Ethan.</p>
                        <h4 class="fw-bold">The City of Egypt</h4>
                        <p class="fs-4">When Costi first released some restrictions with regard to building outwards, he permitted a city to be built in the desert southwest of town. This would be called Egypt and was governed by Alex by default. He built several small structures but was voted out by Amal when elections happened. He got salty and left to create another permitted city on the coast called Sirena Beach. Amal started to build new homes in the area with Costi‚Äôs help but was soon burnt out and Ethan took power. Ethan made a variety of very visually appealing homes on a flattened mountain overlooking the western coast. He was very popular for this but became burnt out when the workload was too intense. Alex took power afterwards but did not do anything with it as no one lived there and he was focused on Sirena Beach which he thought had more potential.</p>
                        <h4 class="fw-bold">The City of Serena Beach</h4>
                        <p class="fs-4">Serena  beach started as a small beach town that flourished over time. Alex started it and built structures and then was voted out in favor of Amal. Amal built modern houses inland and built a lighthouse on a small island off the coast. In the next election, the town‚Äôs development soon came to a halt, as the new mayor Christina built ugly construction zones left unfinished. This was a problem because they were deemed very ugly. She was pulled out of office and wanted to sell the ugly land for a premium to piggyback off of it. Costi took eminent domain powers and seized the land and gave it to Alex, the then incumbent mayor. The town‚Äôs development steadily inclined with Alex but no one really moved in. He was able to make a farm of a variety of goods that were not commonly farmed (little bit of everything) and sold it to Ethan. There were also more houses built and the beach was redesigned for beauty.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold">Costi Survival World 5.5 (2018)</h3>
                        <p class="fs-4">Out of the frustration of the poor performance and glitchy gameplay for Minecraft on Nintendo Switch, Costi created a new world on Minecraft Bedrock edition on PC. This world was different from the worlds that came after it because it did not use any server software. This is because Costi wanted to keep the world accessible from console and other devices (although the Nintendo Switch didn't work with it anyway). There were many glaring flaws with this approach. 1) it alienated the frequent players of the 5th world such as Christina, Amal, and Georges, as they did not have a PC of their own to play. 2) Local split screen multiplayer was and still is not a feature of the game, which used to provide a lot of motivation to play on the 5th world in the first place. These factors led to the early discontinuation of this world. The world's existence was so small, it wouldn't have been considered to count as a Costi Survival world if it wasn't for the transitioning from console to PC gameplay it has begun. Worlds after this one only use PC and are unfortunately not accessible from console (due to needless restrictions on custom servers).</p>
                        <p class="fs-4">This world had a very short history. It originally started just like other worlds. There was a starting building that eventually expanded into a small village. This starting village, called America, is pictured above. Later into the life of the server, Costi decided to go somewhere else to create a new planned city. It had a series of roads with a warehouse. One new idea of this server is that the streets were all named. This idea carried on to the next world CSW6. Costi planned for the citizens of the starting village to move into the new city once it had all the necessary infrastructure.</p>

                        <p class="fs-4">Ross's Dystopia was a world created by Haydon and Alex in Early 2019 on the Nintendo Switch. It started with a small, unroofed house made my haydon with some help from Alex. The house was mainly Haydon's with Alex having a closet with his belongings. After frequent arguments and annoyance about Haydon's reluctance to finish the house and remove junk like redstone, Alex decided to move to a plains biome several hundred blocks away that was named Arkansas pronounced "ar-kansas" (in reference to the famous vine). Alex built his domain there with some farms with the intention to live peacefully. Haydon made frequent excursions to Arkansas and decided to do some trolling. Some of it include firing an arrow from several hundred blocks away when Alex wasn't even in render distance and actually killing him. Haydon also wanted to build a zombie pigmen (now zombie piglin) XP farm which involved hundreds of obsidian. At this point he didn't want to get it all himself, so he forced Alex to mine obsidian in the "gulag" (a ravine with lava on the bottom). Despite the project being successful, it only fueled further tension between the two parties. There was also a time when Alex died in a mine with his stuff, and Haydon retrieved it with the intent to steal Alex's saddle. Alex spawning much closer to both their homes, threatened to burn Haydon's house. When Haydon did not acquiesce, Alex actually did light Haydon's house aflame.
                            A few weeks after the world started, Costi decided to join. He moved far away to a new city called Tik Tok Town (named after the hit new website TikTok). The global currency was unique and not very well implemented. To mint money, Haydon used gold ingots and used a name tag on them, so it does not stack with regular gold ingots. Costi was cheated out of a deal regarding this new currency and as a result, he vowed to take over the world. The world died around June of the same year when Alex broke off connection with Haydon mostly for reasons not pertaining to the world. </p>

                        <p class="fs-4">This world was the first to actually be a server. With its inception in summer 2019, it had a slow start. The spawn point was in an awkward, steep place, and people were inactive in the first few days. Costi lived in a small hut at spawn, but eventually a town was developed across the river. One by one, people quickly started moving in. The town had a large amount of buildings and systems that included the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p class="fs-4">Amelietopia National Park</p></li>

                        <p class="fs-4">This world had a hand selected seed that placed the spawn point on a sizable island with plenty of forests and beaches. They named the island Almonden which was a combination of Almaden and Almond (it reminded Costi of the shape of the island). The server started slow, but with terraforming, the group was able to make a metro area on the western tip of the island. Constantinople was a vibrant and close-knit city with a bridge called "pog path", a villager village, Costi's creeper spawner house, two story vertical farm, and a tall tower that Alex lived in.</p>
                        <h4 class="fw-bold">Costi's house</h4>
                        <p class="fs-4">Costi's house was much more ambitious than the previous servers. It was three stories tall, with each having its own balcony. Unfortunately for Costi, this was also where the vast majority of creepers would spawn, as this location would eventually become infamous for it.
                        <h4 class="fw-bold">Alex's house</h4>
                        <p class="fs-4">Alex originally built a shelter on a small sub-island across the river, and it was promptly destroyed by a series of Sean and creeper attacks to the point where it was unusable. Alex built a bunker shelter ~2000 blocks away with a long journey to go there and stayed there for a while. At one point he got bored with the safety and loneliness of the bunker and decided to slowly move back to Almonden, where he built his domineering tower intentionally designed to look evil. It was a very controversial move on his part, but his reaction to the public reaction was to continue with his home. It rose about 9 floors and ~100 blocks tall in the end. The top featured expanding semi-arches on both sides that made the top of the building longer. This was used as a launchpad for getting to his bunker and other parts of the world via elytra. </p>
                        <p class="fs-4">An interesting bit of further controversy happened when Alex built a nether portal on the wall of the tower, that would send players falling down if they came back from the nether. It was routinely griefed to the point where Alex stopped trying to rebuild it. Later in the server, the building was rendered unusable after a series of griefing and theft.</p>
                        <h4 class="fw-bold">City Hall</h4>
                        <p class="fs-4">Later in the lifespan of the server, Alex decided to create a city hall for Constantinople. He started by clearing a large area as a road leading up to the building. This was met with vigorous controversy, as many citizens thought the area used for the road was excessive and there was little justification given for this other than to "trust" Alex's building design. After a brief period of time to improve the appearance of the newly developed area, the project was forced to shut down. The building was torn down and the large road in front of it was turned into a plaza by Brandon and Costi.</p>
                        <h4 class="fw-bold">Brandon's Beach Resort</h4>
                        <p class="fs-4">Early in the server's lifespan, Brandon decided to build his own city on a neighboring island. He built up a beach-themed resort that had an advanced farm, villager village, and extra houses. Paranoid of the eclectic nature of the city, he was extremely restrictive of visitors and had remarkably strict travel policies that limited travel for all members including the ones he trusted. Growing bored with the world, Brandon quit playing for a period of time and allowed other players to take his items. Costi saved Brandon's most valuable items in a chests underneath the pog path bridge in case he decided to come back. Eventually Brandon did come back, but at that time the server's lifespan was nearing its end.</p>

                        <p class="fs-4">Costi Survival World 8 was created a few months after the 7th. A commonality between these worlds is that the players were experimenting with different types of biomes and cities. Brandon and Alex vouched for a city in the desert, so this seed was selected.</p>
                        <h4 class="fw-bold">Early Civilization</h4>
                        <p class="fs-4">The government in this world was anarchy at first. The first city to exist was Mirage Oasis which was located in the desert. Everyone but Cole lived in this city. Mirage Oasis had no rules or regulations in the beginning, but as time went on, Costi took on a leadership position and slowly advanced it further than other civilizations near the end of the server. The style of Mirage Oasis was quite different from other cities Costi has made. Buildings were made of sandstone, acacia wooden planks, glass, and stone bricks. The city did not have many torches in the beginning because the world generation would create fewer coal ore blocks. Surrounding the village was a cactus wall that partially protected citizens from the frequently spawning enemies (mob spawn rates were reduced shortly after this wall was made). There were very little amenities in the city because there wasn't much comradery. The first to create a developed country was Cole. In the first few weeks of the world, Cole erected a large wooden tower surrounded by a fence in a grassy field near the desert village. He monopolized all oak trees and made an agreement with Costi to uphold it. This agreement lasted through to the end of the server, as Costi used acacia wood instead of oak. Cole's country had many torches to protect it from mobs, and because of this, it remained one of the safest places in the world for a surprisingly long time. After those great advancements, Cole left the world completely, allowing other cities to catch up and advance past.</p>
                        <h4 class="fw-bold">Developing Nations</h4>
                        <p class="fs-4">Burnt out with the idea of creating a desert village, Alex and Brandon decided to venture away and create a new city hundreds of blocks away in a snowy extreme hills biome called Arendelle. The only regular villagers left in Mirage Oasis were Jeremy, Costi, Sean, and Nathan (Brandon and Alex occasionally would visit Mirage Oasis). After Brandon and Alex left, Costi decided to formalize a new government and beautify the city. He added a community farm, lighthouse, tree canopies over the roads, a villager village, and nether base. During this time, Alex and Brandon's city flourished. They built a workshop, drip farm, housing, and a decorative castle. This caused Jeremy to move to Ardelle.</p>
                        <p class="fs-4">It was also during this time when the first version of the Costi Texture pack was created. It was very similar to the regular pack, but the sun was replaced with a Costi emoji, paintings were replaced with memes, and various other changes.</p>
                        <h4 class="fw-bold">Endgame</h4>
                        <p class="fs-4">As Mirage Oasis continued developing, Alex and Brandon visited more frequently. Until eventually, they both decided to move back in. They helped Costi continue making new buildings and decorations such as the museum, O'Hare blimp, nether highway, and island. Brandon created a mansion (his second Mirage Oasis house) located between Cole's country and Mirage Oasis. In this new house, Brandon befriended a nether-mite named Debrah. The server ended because many of the frequent players lost motivation. With the withdrawal of its most frequent players, Costi stopped the server.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold">Costi Survival World 8.5 (2022)</h3>
                        <p class="fs-4">During the winter break of 2022, it was originally planned that Costi would release Costi Survival World 9. However, due to scheduling issues, it was delayed. In its place was Costi Survival World 8.5, an intermission server that was meant to be a casual stepping stone before 9.</p>
                        <h4 class="fw-bold">Early Beginnings</h4>
                        <p class="fs-4">When the world started, early settlers decided to live on a small island near a villager village. The first building to be erected was Cole and Nathan's dual tower house (pictured above). Although the design of it was generally liked among neighbors, Cole mentioned that people who oppose the design would be killed by their newly created communist government. Neighbors would need to pay Cole in food to live around him. Within a few days, this system was overthrown in favor of a loosely planned commune. Costi and Brandon begun to build roads, a farm was created behind Cole and Nathan's house, and a decorative tree park was created in front of the aforementioned house.</p>
                        <h4 class="fw-bold">Rising Tension</h4>
                        <p class="fs-4">Near the middle of the lifespan of the server, Alex decided that he wanted to create a slum area that would later be called the Ghetto. The Ghetto will eventually expand and spark an opposing elitest movement later in the server's lifespan. After watching "Good Burger" on Netflix, Brandon and Costi tried creating movie tie-ins such as Mondo Burger and Good Burger restaurants on the nearby contentment. Additionally, Jeremy created his house, Brandon built his villager village, and a quarry was newly made. Cole "upgraded" his house by creating a third tower connected to the top of the two existing towers, which was widely ridiculed by neighbors. Costi originally predicted the server only to last 2 to 3 weeks, but the server has now surpassed this and was going well into the Spring 2022 semester.</p>
                        <h4 class="fw-bold">General Hostility</h4>
                        <p class="fs-4">The elietes versus the Ghetto was the largest event held on the server. Lasting about 2 weeks long, it consisted of various pranks and buildings meant to annoy the other party. Costi and Brandon were the main spearheads of the elitest movement, while Alex and Nathan were on the Ghetto side. As time went on, the Ghetto got progressively larger and uglier. Alex dug holes in the ground in many spots, built buildings out of undesirable items, and restricted citizens from making it look better. It was during this time when Sean moved into the Ghetto. As a gesture of good faith, Brandon gifted Alex a "monument" in the Ghetto that would explode TNT if a button was pressed. This monument was eventually blown up and as a result, sparked a war. Alex begun spawning hundreds of chickens in the Ghetto, Costi and Brandon decided to build a wall around the Ghetto, Alex created a far nastier building that connected itself to Nathan and Cole's tower, Costi and Brandon "Guccified" their houses by replacing stone brick exteriors with highly expensive items, and other atrocities. On a more peaceful note, Brandon installed a beacon inside the (now very deep) quarry and Costi used a lot of the stone collected from the quarry to begin making a structure in the surrounding ocean (never finished). Near the end of the server's lifespan Cole came back and built a fort on the surrounding continent. The server stopped because this was when school was starting to get back in person for Costi and most people's ambitions about the world had been fulfilled.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold">Costi Survival World 9 (2022)</h3>
                        <p class="fs-4">The 9th world was a highly experimental world that ended up not working out in the end. What sets this apart from the previous worlds is this server was hosted on Minecraft Java edition via Haydon's WOC server. The initial push to switch to Java edition was spearheaded by Costi because at the time he believed using split screen local multiplayer would increase the lifespan of the world. Additionally, Java edition supporters like Nathan and Sean were very vocal about how they prefer Java edition over Bedrock edition. With this in mind, a collaboration was made with Haydon to create a faction within a shared survival world.</p>
                        <p class="fs-4">The world itself was enclosed in a small area, maybe 5,000 blocks on each side. Costi Survival World 9 players were given a portion of the land, while the World of Cat players (WOC) owned the rest of the world. The main base of WOC was located in a new swamp biome, while the Costi Survival World (CSW) base was in a plains biome inside a villager village. The two factions were separated by an ocean and were connected through a witch's hut that contained teleporters that could take you to either faction.</p>
                        <h4 class="fw-bold">Colonial Era</h4>
                        <p class="fs-4">Survival world 9 began with many new and old players. Brandon famously did not make an appearance because he was not interested in playing Minecraft at the time. Some of Alex's friends joined and played very actively for the first week or so before completely stopping. This created a strange wealth distribution where a couple of players were far richer than the rest of the players. The first building made was the capitol building which provided housing for players who did not have a house yet. Alex soon built his house and Sean made a treehouse inside the tree next to it. Alex and Costi then began creating city infrastructure like roads and decorations like the park and dock.</p>
                        <h4 class="fw-bold">City Growth</h4>
                        <p class="fs-4">After the no-life players completed the game and left the world, Costi Survival World 9 managed to keep a healthy amount of players. Notable people include Alex, Sean, Costi, and Cole. Soon, many decorative buildings were erected. Cole built a giant wooden pig house and a floating boat, Alex made a large castle, and Costi continued building roads and built a warehouse. Costi also began working on a subway system that would connect Constantinople to a far away island that someone from WOC tried to annex. Costi also ramped up outreach to people interested in playing on the world. The future of this world was looking bright.</p>
                        <h4 class="fw-bold">Endgame</h4>
                        <p class="fs-4">After a long period of time Costi could not play, activity on the world slowed down significantly. Cole and Nathan would play occasionally and work on their large pig house. Once Costi was able to play again, the three worked together to create a new city on a nearby island named Swinetopia. Costi even begun creating a railway to the developing colony. The server was once again looking bright until Costi created a poll asking if the world should be discontinued in favor of going back to a Costi operated Bedrock based server. The votes in favor were almost unanimous. The reasons for doing so was that most players did not like the sacrifices in performance and world size that came with Java based servers.</p>

                <p>
                    During my time as a cybersecurity Intern at the City of San Jose, I've had the opportunity to contribute to enhancing the city's cybersecurity measures. My responsibilities included handling archived networking logs, ensuring communication with over 7,000 employees regarding enterprise IT projects, and conducting compliance checks using tools like Defender/Sentinel, Splunk, and more. I played a key role in bolstering the city's security posture in various ways such as rolling out multi factor authentication, Zero Trust Network Access, and installing VPNs. I also assisted employees through the Solwarwinds, addressing an average of 100 tickets each month. To combat phishing threats, I utilized various tools such as KnowBe4, Terranova, Armorblox, and O365 ATP. My contributions have been instrumental in fortifying the city's cybersecurity infrastructure and ensuring the safety of our digital assets.
