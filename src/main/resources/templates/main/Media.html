                    2020 was a terrible year for almost everyone. I initially planned this year to be the revitalization of Amal +, the Ethan Show, and even making new shows. However, this idea was abruptly ended once the pandemic caused lockdown restrictions. The videos I made this year were mostly memory slideshows to highlight previous moments in my life.

                        Filmed in 2016, this video was a parody of the infamous PPAP video that was popular at the time. This project was never edited because I thought it was cringy at the time, which was exactly why I edited it in 2020. This is the last Costi Entertainment branded video. The editing used here is far better than what I made in 2016, which is a good indicator of the progression of my skill.

                    2019 was a very different kind of video for me in terms of the videos I made. The Ethan Show was officially cancelled, Amal + was long gone, and the Pioneer News got almost my full attention. I also got to make San Jose Tips videos with friends. I was so busy with projects, that I didn't even get to create an animated intro logo for Costi Entertainment. In fact, there was no mention of this alias at all for my videos in 2019.

                        This was the very last episode of the Pioneer news. I wanted to make it extra special. I added in new elements, styled the transitions and other elements to promote the yearbook, added a special iCarly intro, a tribute to the multimedia class we had (I was not the person filming), and finally, the Pioneer Montage. The Pioneer Montage was a collection of student-submitted videos edited with music and special effects. It was meant to be my last goodbye to my school.

                        This episode took a lot of effort for me. I further refined the top and bottom letter boxing panels, I re-did the intro, added in different background music (suggested by Ryan), tweaked a lot of the special effects, added in a stressful countdown to the next AP test that was timed specifically to be accurate when it aired, added an "at a glance" intro, and made a special part on the end that served as an overview of the upcoming AP tests (some thought that the images used were official, but I made them).

                        In this episode, I began editing episodes with the cooperation of my good friend Ryan Zimbauer. He helped me with editing the leadership videos that would come in and the moving background. Cory Robertson, another close friend, helped me film the drone footage for the new intro. I also added refinements to the aforementioned elements on the top and bottom.

                        Although this is not the second episode of the Pioneer News ever, it was the second episode I edited. Near the middle of my last semester of high school, my multimedia teacher could not find any more people to edit the news. I decided to step up and handle editing from then on. In this episode, I learned from the previous episode I made and added some new features. For example, I knew that the projectors in school were 4:3, so I decided to use lettering to add in an agenda and additional information panels. Also, I dabbed at the end üíÄ

                        Following the reception of second episode, I decided to shorten certain segments of the show to make it more watchable. The original version of this episode was over 23 mins! This new version is 16 mins. It has better editing, smoother green screen effects, and more.

                        This was the first of many videos I would make to invite my friends to an after school party hosted on the last day of school.

In this video, I listed the video-games and activities present as well as the details of the event. For obvious reasons, I am not going to have this video shown here.

The Ethan Show went on to have 2 more episodes and an unfinished 4th episode. Unfortunately, I will not be having the first episode available to the public.

                        This video is a wacky music video for the pacer test audio used in our schools. It features 3 Alex clones. The left one is supposed to be playing an instrument, but keeps getting texts on his phone; the center Alex is the "singer"; and the Alex on the right is incorrectly playing a recorder. The video skips around the test in strange ways.

                        This video was made out of boredom when I was stuck in my house. I wanted to venture and try out a genre I haven't tried making before: horror. Having watched all the Harry Potter movies, I took inspiration from their cinematography and created this video. For what it was, I think it came out pretty well. Additionally, the end of the video is advertising a very short-lived rebrand of my video production alias to Costi T.V.

                        This is what I called the 4th iteration of my logo. The first version was shown below and was off center, the second was the orb version, and the third was the same as the first version except grey and tilted 45 degrees. This logo is important to me because it was used in many, many projects once it was made. This is because the image did not have any blank padding on the sides and was perfectly centered.

                    In 2015, I made a very large amount of videos. I have reached a reconnaissance of video production in a way. I got access to Adobe CS5 and CS4 software packs, and I was self-teaching based on what I had learned from school and just trying things out. Each video would try out a new technique or idea and the next video would utilize what I had learned from before and add further experimentation. 2015 was home to many iconic videos such as Amal +.

                        This episode of Amal + utilized my previous finds from the first episode and built off of it with all-new segments that had far better quality. I also continued to experiment with video effects and strategies. For example, I tried keying the opacity of the green screen videos dynamically, changing the way I keyed out the green screen, and experimented with music videos (which Tina and Amal were very keen on trying).

                        Amal + episode 1 was a series of unrelated video segments that played right after each other. The main idea of this video was to test and try out new ideas for videos. The discoveries I made when making this video were super integral to the videos I made afterwards. For example some things I tried in this video was to use a different color for the green screen, having multiple layers of video, green screen color correction, hue filters, and most importantly, backing up videos. At the time, I had stored all raw videos on my camera's SD card and when I ran out of space, I formatted the card, not understanding that my videos were being deleted. I only have an old version of the video that I thankfully exported earlier, however I will not be showing it here because the segments in it are a bit too weird. Amal + would eventually have 2 sequels.

                        This is the second iteration of my animated logo series. Initially, this video was supposed to be made in Flash, but since I had just gotten the full Adobe suite from my aunt, I was able to utilize the latest software (at the time). This time, my logo would play on all videos I made unless it was for school. The music used in this logo was taken from a Nintendo Direct. After making this video, I decided to completely phase out Flash in favor of After Effects.

Initially starting in 2011 and ending in 2015, I used to make simple Flash animations, vector artwork, and short movies with iMovie. I found myself a portable version of Flash 8 and Fireworks back when they were owned by Macromedia and begun my work. It was during this time when I found a passion for creating media. I also bought myself a simple video editor to tinker with. Along with making my first animated logo, I had made the Terency show, a flash-based school project, begun working on a Flash game, and made a trailer for it.</p>

                    This was a trailer designed to promote a game I was making at the time using Flash. The game would have been a playformer where Terence was the main character. The goal was to collect all food items on the screen before they go rotten. The website mentioned in that email does not exist anymore, but is safely backed up in <a href="https://github.com/CKhamis/Angrybird-Wiki">Github.</a>

The Overpriced Pencil was a short video me and two others made in a black-and-white style. Jason was a parody of the movie Jason with a lot of extra jokes added to it. The AngryBird remix video was a side project I was making that basically was edits of the AngryBirds Toons videos.</p>

                    <p class="card-text fs-5">This video was made for my advanced multimedia class I took in 8th grade. The title is "Wrap" because I did not know how to spell rap at the time. It featured me and another student. It heavily used a green screen, so I could add backup dancers as myself. It was one of the more creative videos I made for this class because I used a special technique to add in clones of myself where I nested videos on top of each other.</p>

At the time, I was not skilled enough to speed up the mouth movements, so we had to slow down our dialogue. This video was made in association with 2 others from my class. The ending of this video was meant to satisfy a duration constraint for this project. I do not remember what I got on this project, but ignorance is bliss...</p>

I do not remember much about the production of this video, but it may have used either iMovie or my $2 video editor I had at the time. This video was important because it sparked my interest in making personal videos.</p>

                        This was the very first animated logo I made. It was made using Flash 8. It was meant to be featured in the videos I would eventually make. The production of this video was very hard for me because I was unable to import my vector art from Fireworks, so I had to remake the logo. Animating the logo was also much harder than I thought at the time because the alignment of the squares would somehow always be wrong.

                    <p class="card-text fs-5">This is a new logo I have made using Macromedia Fireworks 8 following a YouTube tutorial. At the time, I wanted to make a skeuomorphic version of my logo to match current trends. This logo always reminded me of the dismiss/expand/close buttons on Macs at the time. If you look closely, this logo uses the first logo with a gradient on each square. This new version of my logo was used in the Terency Show.</p>

                    <p class="card-text fs-5">Although my logo's origin predates the creation of this image, this logo was the first digital version ever made of it. Created in Macromedia Fireworks, it is one of the first vector-based artwork I have ever made. I remember having a very hard time aligning the squares and positioning the logo within the much larger canvas. Nevertheless, this logo was used in many of my creations until 2015 due to the logo being off center in the canvas.</p>
