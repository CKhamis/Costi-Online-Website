                <p class="fs-4">The Costi Inc. Era was the very first stage in Cost Media's evolution. Initially starting in 2011 and ending in 2015, I used to make simple Flash animations, vector artwork, and short movies with iMovie. I found myself a portable version of Flash 8 and Fireworks back when they were owned by Macromedia and begun my work. It was during this time when I found a passion for creating media. I also bought myself a simple video editor to tinker with. Along with making my first animated logo, I had made the Terency show, a flash-based school project, begun working on a Flash game, and made a trailer for it.</p>

                    <p class="card-text fs-5">I made 3 other videos in my 8th grade advanced multimedia class. I have chosen not to post them because they involve personal information. The Overpriced Pencil was a short video me and two others made in a black-and-white style. Jason was a parody of the movie Jason with a lot of extra jokes added to it. The AngryBird remix video was a side project I was making that basically was edits of the AngryBirds Toons videos.</p>

                    <p class="card-text fs-5">This video was made for my advanced multimedia class I took in 8th grade. The title is "Wrap" because I did not know how to spell rap at the time. It featured me and another student. It heavily used a green screen, so I could add backup dancers as myself. It was one of the more creative videos I made for this class because I used a special technique to add in clones of myself where I nested videos on top of each other.</p>

At the time, I was not skilled enough to speed up the mouth movements, so we had to slow down our dialogue. This video was made in association with 2 others from my class. The ending of this video was meant to satisfy a duration constraint for this project. I do not remember what I got on this project, but ignorance is bliss...</p>

This video was important because it sparked my interest in making personal videos.</p>

                        This was the very first animated logo I made. It was made using Flash 8. It was meant to be featured in the videos I would eventually make. The production of this video was very hard for me because I was unable to import my vector art from Fireworks, so I had to remake the logo. Animating the logo was also much harder than I thought at the time because the alignment of the squares would somehow always be wrong.

                    <p class="card-text fs-5">This is a new logo I have made using Macromedia Fireworks 8 following a YouTube tutorial. At the time, I wanted to make a skeuomorphic version of my logo to match current trends. This logo always reminded me of the dismiss/expand/close buttons on Macs at the time. If you look closely, this logo uses the first logo with a gradient on each square. This new version of my logo was used in the Terency Show.</p>

                    <p class="card-text fs-5">Although my logo's origin predates the creation of this image, this logo was the first digital version ever made of it. Created in Macromedia Fireworks, it is one of the first vector-based artwork I have ever made. I remember having a very hard time aligning the squares and positioning the logo within the much larger canvas. Nevertheless, this logo was used in many of my creations until 2015 due to the logo being off center in the canvas.</p>
