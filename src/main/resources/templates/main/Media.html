I quickly became known for my work, as I used it as an opportunity to try creating special effects and editing styles.

Starting in middle school, I began to take initiative and revive these after school hangouts. I created videos for them from 2016 to 2017 (inc).

                        My logo has existed for well over a decade. Conceptualized around 2010, it was inspired by a friend's logo, which was inspired by the Nintendo GameCube logo. Over the years, I have consistently used my logo for personal projects, internal documentation, and publicly facing projects (like this website). Like other vector based artwork I made the time, the first and second logos were made using Macromedia Fireworks 8. This was because I first learned how to use it for my multimedia 1 class in middle school. Eventually, I was given the Adobe CS4 and CS5 suite by my aunt and created my third logo. In High School, I found a way to get the full Adobe Suite for $20 a year, and since Fireworks was discontinued by Adobe, I began to use Adobe Illustrator, which I still use to this day. The 4th Logo was used in my work from 2016 to 2018, until I invented my most recent logo. My newest logo is a lot easier to consume, dense, and aesthetically coherent.

                        The first normal, non-animated logo used for Costi Media/Entertainment was created in 2018. It was made because I needed a logo for my YouTube channel which hosted the Ethan Show. You can still see the first logo displayed in the outro of the Ethan Show Episode 3. The second logo, "E", was created in the same year, along with my new personal logo. This was only used for one project and was not in any videos I made. In 2019, I created the "M" logo and renamed the YouTube channel to Costi Media. This was because the video content I was making at the time was more professional and not only for entertainment. Finally, in 2020, I re-did the logo again in 2020 because I thought the previous one was too plain and unrecognizable.
