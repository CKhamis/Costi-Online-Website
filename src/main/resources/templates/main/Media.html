I quickly became known for my work, as I used it as an opportunity to try creating special effects and editing styles.

Starting in middle school, I began to take initiative and revive these after school hangouts. I created videos for them from 2016 to 2017 (inc).

                        My logo has existed for well over a decade. Conceptualized around 2010, it was inspired by a friend's logo, which was inspired by the Nintendo GameCube logo. Over the years, I have consistently used my logo for personal projects, internal documentation, and publicly facing projects (like this website). Like other vector based artwork I made the time, the first and second logos were made using Macromedia Fireworks 8. This was because I first learned how to use it for my multimedia 1 class in middle school. Eventually, I was given the Adobe CS4 and CS5 suite by my aunt and created my third logo. In High School, I found a way to get the full Adobe Suite for $20 a year, and since Fireworks was discontinued by Adobe, I began to use Adobe Illustrator, which I still use to this day. The 4th Logo was used in my work from 2016 to 2018, until I invented my most recent logo. My newest logo is a lot easier to consume, dense, and aesthetically coherent.

                        The first normal, non-animated logo used for Costi Media/Entertainment was created in 2018. It was made because I needed a logo for my YouTube channel which hosted the Ethan Show. You can still see the first logo displayed in the outro of the Ethan Show Episode 3. The second logo, "E", was created in the same year, along with my new personal logo. This was only used for one project and was not in any videos I made. In 2019, I created the "M" logo and renamed the YouTube channel to Costi Media. This was because the video content I was making at the time was more professional and not only for entertainment. Finally, in 2020, I re-did the logo again in 2020 because I thought the previous one was too plain and unrecognizable.

                                For my dad's political campaign, I was tasked with making testimonial videos with as many of his supporters as possible for their advertising campaign. This is one of several videos I was asked to modify slightly in the same way as the original ad.

                    2020 was a terrible year for almost everyone. I initially planned this year to be the revitalization of Amal+, the Ethan Show, and even making new shows. However, this idea was abruptly ended once the pandemic caused lockdown restrictions. The videos I made this year were mostly memory slideshows to highlight previous moments in my life.

                                Filmed in 2016, this video was a parody of the infamous PPAP video that was popular at the time. This project was never edited because I thought it was cringy at the time, which was exactly why I edited it in 2020. This is the last Costi Entertainment branded video. The editing used here is far better than what I made in 2016, which is a good indicator of the progression of my skill.

The Ethan Show was officially cancelled, Amal+ was long gone, and the Pioneer News got almost my full attention. I also got to make San Jose Tips videos with friends. I was so busy with projects, that I didn't even get to create an animated intro logo for Costi Entertainment. In fact, there was no mention of this alias at all for my videos in 2019.

                                This was the very last episode of the Pioneer news. I wanted to make it extra special. I added in new elements, styled the transitions and other elements to promote the yearbook, added a special iCarly intro, a tribute to the multimedia class we had (I was not the person filming), and finally, the Pioneer Montage. The Pioneer Montage was a collection of student-submitted videos edited with music and special effects. It was meant to be my last goodbye to my school.

                                This episode took a lot of effort for me. I further refined the top and bottom letter boxing panels, I re-did the intro, added in different background music (suggested by Ryan), tweaked a lot of the special effects, added in a stressful countdown to the next AP test that was timed specifically to be accurate when it aired, added an "at a glance" intro, and made a special part on the end that served as an overview of the upcoming AP tests (some thought that the images used were official, but I made them).

                                Although this is not the second episode of the Pioneer News ever, it was the second episode I edited. Near the middle of my last semester of high school, my multimedia teacher could not find any more people to edit the news. I decided to step up and handle editing from then on. In this episode, I learned from the previous episode I made and added some new features. For example, I knew that the projectors in school were 4:3, so I decided to use lettering to add in an agenda and additional information panels. Also, I dabbed at the end üíÄ

                    2018 was an important year for me. This was a transition period between the silly videos I was making previously and more presentable, more planned videos. This included more videos from San Jose Tips and the Ethan Show.

                                My logo was re-designed in 2018 to make it nicer on the eyes. The individual squares are larger and closer together. Previously, the gap between each square was the same as their length. Now, they are spaced out by the width of the "E" in the old Costi entertainment logo. This version of my logo is still used today, and can be found even on the footer of this page.

                                In my multimedia class, every student was tasked with making a weekly episode of the school news at least once a semester whether you liked it or not. In this case, I did not want to edit the news, and although I added some cool new ideas like transitions, I did not put too much effort into it. Unfortunately, I have lost all the files and the original link to this video, so it is lost forever.

I used advanced layering techniques for this video. Unfortunately, this is the last episode of the Ethan Show that was fully finished.

I stopped making invitational videos because the medium was too limiting and most of the hard work that went into them went unappreciated.

The Ethan Show went on to have 2 more episodes and an unfinished 4th episode. Unfortunately, I will not be having the first episode available to the public.

In this episode, Kristi will show you how to report a broken street light on the My San Jose app. This video idea was met with praise among the city council, and caught the interest of San Jose mayor San Liccardo, who was featured in the intro of this episode.

The video skips around the test in strange ways.

                            This video was made out of boredom when I was stuck in my house. I wanted to venture and try out a genre I haven't tried making before: horror. Having watched all the Harry Potter movies, I took inspiration from their cinematography and created this video. For what it was, I think it came out pretty well. Additionally, the end of the video is advertising a very short-lived rebrand of my video production alias to Costi T.V.

                                This is what I called the 4th iteration of my logo. The first version was shown below and was off center, the second was the orb version, and the third was the same as the first version except grey and tilted 45 degrees. This logo is important to me because it was used in many, many projects once it was made. This is because the image did not have any blank padding on the sides and was perfectly centered.

                    In 2015, I made a very large amount of videos. I have reached a reconnaissance of video production in a way. I got access to Adobe CS5 and CS4 software packs, and I was self-teaching based on what I had learned from school and just trying things out. Each video would try out a new technique or idea and the next video would utilize what I had learned from before and add further experimentation. 2015 was home to many iconic videos such as Amal+.

For example, I tried keying the opacity of the green screen videos dynamically, changing the way I keyed out the green screen, and experimented with music videos (which Tina and Amal were very keen on trying).

I was asked to film at this event and create a highlight reel of it for the rest of the students to see. This is what I made. Although this project was very simple compared to what I was doing at the time, it was a new kind of video I got to try making myself.

                                After much frustration with the lack of reliability with my wifi, I decided to voice my frustration in the form of a video. In the making of this video, I got to learn how to use keying effects with filters and got a little more experience with a new video genre.

                                Amal+ episode 1 was a series of unrelated video segments that played right after each other. The main idea of this video was to test and try out new ideas for videos. The discoveries I made when making this video were super integral to the videos I made afterwards. For example some things I tried in this video was to use a different color for the green screen, having multiple layers of video, green screen color correction, hue filters, and most importantly, backing up videos. At the time, I had stored all raw videos on my camera's SD card and when I ran out of space, I formatted the card, not understanding that my videos were being deleted. I only have an old version of the video that I thankfully exported earlier, however I will not be showing it here because the segments in it are a bit too weird. Amal+ would eventually have 2 sequels.

                                This is the second iteration of my animated logo series. Initially, this video was supposed to be made in Flash, but since I had just gotten the full Adobe suite from my aunt, I was able to utilize the latest software (at the time). This time, my logo would play on all videos I made unless it was for school. The music used in this logo was taken from a Nintendo Direct. After making this video, I decided to completely phase out Flash in favor of After Effects.

Initially starting in 2011 and ending in 2015, I used to make simple Flash animations, vector artwork, and short movies with iMovie. I found myself a portable version of Flash 8 and Fireworks back when they were owned by Macromedia and begun my work. It was during this time when I found a passion for creating media. I also bought myself a simple video editor to tinker with. Along with making my first animated logo, I had made the Terency show, a flash-based school project, begun working on a Flash game, and made a trailer for it.</p>

The production of this video was very hard for me because I was unable to import my vector art from Fireworks, so I had to remake the logo. Animating the logo was also much harder than I thought at the time because the alignment of the squares would somehow always be wrong.

Created in Macromedia Fireworks, it is one of the first vector-based artwork I have ever made. I remember having a very hard time aligning the squares and positioning the logo within the much larger canvas. Nevertheless, this logo was used in many of my creations until 2015 due to the logo being off center in the canvas.</p>
