                    In 2015, I made a very large amount of videos. I have reached a reconnaissance of video production in a way. I got access to Adobe CS5 and CS4 software packs, and I was self-teaching based on what I had learned from school and just trying things out. Each video would try out a new technique or idea and the next video would utilize what I had learned from before and add further experimentation. 2015 was home to many iconic videos such as Amal +.

                        This episode of Amal + utilized my previous finds from the first episode and built off of it with all-new segments that had far better quality. I also continued to experiment with video effects and strategies. For example, I tried keying the opacity of the green screen videos dynamically, changing the way I keyed out the green screen, and experimented with music videos (which Tina and Amal were very keen on trying).

                        Amal + episode 1 was a series of unrelated video segments that played right after each other. The main idea of this video was to test and try out new ideas for videos. The discoveries I made when making this video were super integral to the videos I made afterwards. For example some things I tried in this video was to use a different color for the green screen, having multiple layers of video, green screen color correction, hue filters, and most importantly, backing up videos. At the time, I had stored all raw videos on my camera's SD card and when I ran out of space, I formatted the card, not understanding that my videos were being deleted. I only have an old version of the video that I thankfully exported earlier, however I will not be showing it here because the segments in it are a bit to weird. Amal + would eventually have 2 sequels.

                        This is the second iteration of my animated logo series. Initially, this video was supposed to be made in Flash, but since I had just gotten the full Adobe suite from my aunt, I was able to utilize the latest software (at the time). This time, my logo would play on all videos I made unless it was for school. The music used in this logo was taken from a Nintendo Direct. After making this video, I decided to completely phase out Flash in favor of After Effects.

                <p class="fs-4">The Costi Inc. Era was the very first stage in Cost Media's evolution. Initially starting in 2011 and ending in 2015, I used to make simple Flash animations, vector artwork, and short movies with iMovie. I found myself a portable version of Flash 8 and Fireworks back when they were owned by Macromedia and begun my work. It was during this time when I found a passion for creating media. I also bought myself a simple video editor to tinker with. Along with making my first animated logo, I had made the Terency show, a flash-based school project, begun working on a Flash game, and made a trailer for it.</p>

                    This was a trailer designed to promote a game I was making at the time using Flash. The game would have been a playformer where Terence was the main character.

It featured me and another student. It heavily used a green screen, so I could add backup dancers as myself. It was one of the more creative videos I made for this class because I used a special technique to add in clones of myself where I nested videos on top of each other.</p>

                        This was the very first animated logo I made. It was made using Flash 8. It was meant to be featured in the videos I would eventually make. The production of this video was very hard for me because I was unable to import my vector art from Fireworks, so I had to remake the logo. Animating the logo was also much harder than I thought at the time because the alignment of the squares would somehow always be wrong.

                    <p class="card-text fs-5">This is a new logo I have made using Macromedia Fireworks 8 following a YouTube tutorial. At the time, I wanted to make a skeuomorphic version of my logo to match current trends. This logo always reminded me of the dismiss/expand/close buttons on Macs at the time. If you look closely, this logo uses the first logo with a gradient on each square. This new version of my logo was used in the Terency Show.</p>

                    <p class="card-text fs-5">Although my logo's origin predates the creation of this image, this logo was the first digital version ever made of it. Created in Macromedia Fireworks, it is one of the first vector-based artwork I have ever made. I remember having a very hard time aligning the squares and positioning the logo within the much larger canvas. Nevertheless, this logo was used in many of my creations until 2015 due to the logo being off center in the canvas.</p>
