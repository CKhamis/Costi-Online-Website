# Costi Online

Costi Online is a website I designed and built using Java Spring and Hibernate. It is currently being hosted on [costionline.com](costionline.com). Costi Online is a centralized publicly-facing informative website that is centered around me, my friends, my projects, and more. The backend of the website is based on Java Spring and Java Hibernate with an H2 databse. I use both Hibernate and JPA queries for CRUD operations. The front end of the website uses Bootstrap 5 as well as its JavaScript dependencies. This website uses many of the skills I have built up over my 10+ years of experience in Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Costi Labs
Costi Labs is a feature that showcases select projects that visitors can directly interact with. The first experiment added into Costi Labs is an LED Light controller that allows Costi Online visitors to remotely change the colors of LED light strips located on the same wifi network.
## Axcel Minigame
Costi Online features my pet dog, Axcel. When clicked, Axcel will ask you if you can help him find his lost toys. If you accept, small toys will appear inside various pages of the website that the user must click on. When all toys are found, the user must return them to Axcel back on the home screen to reveal the newly made About Axcel page.
## Costi Newsroom
Costi Newsroom is a relatively new feature of the website that is most similar to a blog. The owner of the website is able to add new content on demand to display in the Newsroom page. Users can then view these posts in a chronological order. Posts can be under many categories including Update, Event, Journal, Article, Emergency, Achievement, News, and Discovery. All content displayed in newsoom is editable, deletable, and viewable within Costi Online's custom content management system, COMT. For the first time ever in Costi Online's history, you are now able to upload a custom image for each newsroom post, with the option to change the photo once uploaded
## Costipedia (Online Wiki)
Costipedia is an online wiki similar to Wikipedia and article publishers. If you have an account, you will be able to create and edit your own wiki pages. Wiki pages need to be approved by a moderator before it is published to the website. Content in the wiki has to be related to the categories that are on the Wiki homepage.
## Costi Survival World X
A major feature of this website is to inform players in my newest Minecraft survival world, Costi Survival World X. For example, the Your Government page will show you the general rules of the world. It also contains the world history from all the previous Minecraft worlds I have played on and/or created. You will also be able to participate in polls and campaign voting for the in-game government.
## Costi Projects
View a mostly complete repository of my previous coding based projects. I have included a brief description of each of my projects, along with the year it was made and its current status. I have separated my projects into "eras." These eras mostly are made for personal reasons, but it also separates my projects by my talent level over time.
## Other Features
### Theming
My website is designed to have an automatically changing theme based on the date of the year. For example, during July, my website is themed after Windows XP
### Moderator Tools
I have implemented a moderator terminal in my website that allows me to change specific things. For example, I can enable or disable user accounts. I can also edit/delete/publish wiki articles.
### Announcements
Costi Online now features announcements. Announcements can be created, edited, privated, published, and deleted all from the moderator terminal. They will appear on the home page and are dismissable.
### User Roles
There are 3 types of roles on Costi Online. Owner, Admin, and User. The owner user can only be created when you make the first account and select administrator in a hidden drop down menu. The other two roles can be created whenever needed. You activate admin/owner accounts by clicking on a link in the java console after you press create account. Admin and Owner accounts can access the moderator terminal, but the owner is unable to be disabled/locked/demoted. Admin accounts are able to get a permenet demotion.
