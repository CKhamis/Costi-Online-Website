# Costi Online

Costi Online is a website I designed and built using Java Spring and Hibernate. It is currently being hosted on [costionline.com](costionline.com). Currently, it is focused on my upcoming Minecraft server, Costi Survival World 9, but I plan on making the website more general to include other projects and documentation.


## Costi Survival World 9
This website's main purpose at the moment is to provide players of my Minecraft server information about upcoming events, rules, and host votes. The Your Government page lists the main idea of the server, history of previous servers (with download links, and FAQs. The Voting Center tab provides users with documentation and Google Forms to participate in server elections. I will continue adding more features to this website as time goes on.
