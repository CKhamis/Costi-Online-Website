# Costi Online

Costi Online is a website I designed and built using Java Spring and Hibernate. It is currently being hosted on [costionline.com](costionline.com). Costi Online is a centralized publicly-facing informative website that is centered around me, my friends, my projects, and more. The backend of the website is based on Java Spring and Java Hibernate with an H2 databse. I use both Hibernate and JPA queries for CRUD operations. The front end of the website uses Bootstrap 5 as well as its JavaScript dependencies. This website uses many of the skills I have built up over my 10+ years of experience in Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Costipedia (Online Wiki)
Costipedia is an online wiki similar to Wikipedia and article publishers. If you have an account, you will be able to create and edit your own wiki pages. Wiki pages need to be approved by a moderator before it is published to the website. Content in the wiki has to be related to the categories that are on the Wiki homepage.
## Costi Survival World 9
A major feature of this website is to inform players in my newest Minecraft survival world, Costi Survival World 9. For example, the Your Government page will show you the general rules of the world. It also contains the world history from all the previous Minecraft worlds I have played on and/or created. You will also be able to participate in polls and campaign voting for the in-game government.
## Costi Projects
View a mostly complete repository of my previous coding based projects. I have included a brief description of each of my projects, along with the year it was made and its current status. I have separated my projects into "eras." These eras mostly are made for personal reasons, but it also separates my projects by my talent level over time.
## Other Features
### Theming
My website is designed to have an automatically changing theme based on the date of the year. For example, during July, my website is themed after Windows XP
### Moderator Tools
I have implemented a moderator terminal in my website that allows me to change specific things. For example, I can enable or disable user accounts. I can also edit/delete/publish wiki articles.
